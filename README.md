# Honors Thesis Replication Repository: ARIMA-Based Bootstrap for IV–Local Projections

This repository accompanies **Yesui Nyamchuluun’s Honors Thesis (University of Minnesota, 2025)** titled  
> *“State-Dependent Fiscal Policy Effects: ARIMA-Based Bootstrap Meets Local Projections.”*

The project replicates and extends the econometric framework of **Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2020)** (*Journal of Monetary Economics*), translating their Stata-based IV–Local Projection (IV–LP) design into a fully transparent, reproducible **Python implementation**.  
It introduces an **ARIMA-based bootstrap** procedure to evaluate finite-sample inference robustness in estimating fiscal multipliers across different business-cycle regimes.

## Methodological Summary

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Combines fiscal, JST, and CAPB datasets at the country–year level.  
- Constructs growth, fiscal consolidation, and cumulative response variables.  
- Applies the **Hodrick–Prescott filter (λ = 400)** to extract cyclical components of GDP and define **boom** and **slump** states.  

### 2. ARIMA Model Selection  
- Fits ARIMA(p,0,q) models to detrended GDP residuals.  
- Selects a single common specification minimizing **AIC/BIC**, saved in `common_arima_order.json`.

### 3. Instrumented Local Projections (IV–LP)

The estimated regression takes the form:

  using **2SLS** regressions instrumenting *dCAPB* with within-country demeaned *size*.  
- Includes controls (_x₁–x₆_) consistent with the baseline JST specification.

### 4. ARIMA-Based Bootstrap  
- Simulates residual paths under the fitted ARIMA process.  
- Recomputes IV–LP regressions for each draw to obtain empirical χ² distributions.  
- Provides **joint** and **horizon-specific** bootstrap p-values under finite-sample uncertainty.
